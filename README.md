# Bonus
I use the [Kripton theme](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1365372). I'm typically not a fan of the macOS-like window controls, but since we're on Hyprland, we don't have to worry about that.

I also thought I'd drop in my own userChrome minimalistic setup for Firefox. I typically remove everything from the navbr save for the extensions and downloads buttons. As for the addons I use to complete the theme's look, here you go:

- [Adaptive Tab Bar Color](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adaptive-tab-bar-colour/)
- [Australis-like refresh in URL bar](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/australis-refresh-in-url-bar/)
- [Load Progress Bar](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/load-progress-bar/)
