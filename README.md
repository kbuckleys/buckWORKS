# Premise
In my search for a GTK theme, I stumbled upon an old one called Kripton, which I found it to be quite beautiful, but it didn't quite fit in with the rest of my setup. So I took it upon myself and created a Kripton color palette based on the GTK theme, and then made Kripton themes for the software I use. This is going to be a work in progress, as I'm considering taking this seriously and kickstart a project to cover as many software and websites as possible. I highly doubt it could ever be on the same level as Catppuccin's or Nord's, but it's an enticing idea all the same.

# Notes
The depnedencies listed are for my own reference and to insure functions of my setup work as intended.

I thought I'd also drop in my own userChrome minimalistic setup for Firefox. I typically remove everything from the navbr save for the extensions and downloads buttons. As for the addons I use to complete the theme's look, here you go:

- [Adaptive Tab Bar Color](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adaptive-tab-bar-colour/)
- [Australis-like refresh in URL bar](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/australis-refresh-in-url-bar/)
- [Load Progress Bar](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/load-progress-bar/)
